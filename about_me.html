			Electrical Engineer from the Regional University of the Northwest of the State of Rio Grande do Sul (UNIJUÍ - Santa Rosa Campus), enthusiast of renewable energy, electric mobility, and artificial intelligence. <br>

			During my undergraduate studies, I participated in a research project focused on renewable energy and an extension project working on topics related to electrical safety, energy efficiency, and technological waste. I taught educational robotics classes and, together with colleagues, developed Biotech Biodigestores (a company focused on biodigester automation), which was pre-incubated in the CRIATEC business incubator. I interned in the Maintenance Engineering Department at John Deere and worked as a Data Analyst at VIACERTA Banking. <br>

		I am currently pursuing a master’s degree in Electrical Engineering at the Federal University of Santa Maria (UFSM) in the Center of Excellence in Energy and Power Systems (CEESP).

		I have experience in teaching, developing key performance indicators (KPIs) in Power BI, using Python and SQL programming languages for data analysis and knowledge in Data Science, microgrids, renewable energy and Artificial Intelligence.
